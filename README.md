INTRODUCTION 
THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT ANALYZING DIFFERENT TERRAINS THROUGH CONVOLUTIONAL  NEURAL NETWORK.






IMPORTANCE OF TERRAIN ANALYZING IN  AGRICULTURE 


Farm strategies and economic results seem to be related to entrepreneurial characteristics as much as to natural constraints. The analysis of Pillar I payments and RDP payments for farms located in this mountainous area shows a very complex situation where the strategies implemented by farmers of the strongest farming styles may successfully counteract natural constraints. Besides, in the Authorsâ€™ opinion, the analyses performed highlight the importance of spatial analysis as a tool for evaluating how public resources are distributed on a territory, thus providing also useful information on the way this distribution could be improved, e.g. for ensuring a higher level of environmental services[1]

This dataset features:-
* 514 images of 3 classes
* Class 1 174 images of Jakhal (Haryana)
* Class 2 189 images of Una (Himachal Pradesh)
* Class 3  151 images of Hathnoda (Rajasthan) 
* Dataset includes images from 1st January 2014 to 3rd May 2022
* Cloud coverage 0% to 50% (min to max)

Challenges
* The Clouds cover  some regions of the image. Very few images were available with minimum Cloud
* In Each bundle of image only 21 image were usable because formats of images were very different jpg, tiff, json, text not all were convertible 


Conclusion
Knowing the terrain of a farm is very important because different terrain needs very different treatment and by analyzing we strategically grow crops accordingly rather than following surrounding people where it changes drastically. 


This model can predict the terrain of land with the accuracy of 95.35%
